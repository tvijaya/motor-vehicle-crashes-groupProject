### Project Description/Outline
##### We are investigating U.S. motor vehicle accidents in 2016 to better understand the causes and aftereffects of these accidents.
```
1. Objective/Introduction to Topic - Why are we investigating motor vehicle crashes?
2. Methodology
   - Data Cleaning Process
   - Data Exploration
3. Analysis of Crashes based on the following factors:
   - Weather
   - Lighting Condtions
   - Time of Day
   - Harmful Effects 
3. Summarize Findings
```
### Research Questions to Answer
```
1.    WEATHER
      Is there a correlation between weather and the manner of collision? 
      Does bad weather lead to an increased number of accidents? - Charlie
2.    LIGHTING CONDITIONS 
      What causes of accidents from police report(CF) and Harmful Events were associated with Lighting? 
      Is there association between the number of fatalities and lighting? 
      What about drunk driving and lighting?
3.    TIME OF DAY
      What are some differences between holidays/weekend vs weekday crashes in relation to the number of fatalities, whether drunk      driving was involved, the time of hour and type of harmful events.  
      Which states and counties had the most crashes?
4.    HARMFUL EVENTS 
      What types of crash occur more frequently, for what age groups?  
      How does this compare to 2015 data?
